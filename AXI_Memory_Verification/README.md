# AXI Memory Verification
---------------------------------------

*Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) is an on-chip communication bus protocol which is part of the Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture specification (AMBA).Here we are using an AXI memory as DUT*<br>
<br>

## Tasks
1. AXI protocol understanding
2. Obtain synthesizable design
3. List of properties to be covered
4. Assumptions
5. Assertions
6. Running and debugging
